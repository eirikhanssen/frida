# frida
Cristin metadata extraction with DSpace submission autofill using user scripts (tapermonkey/greasemonkey)

To actually make this work, Saxonce is needed. It should be installed in to the frida directory.

When it works, one can paste an xml-file with cristin metadata, get html extracted, and then auto-fill in DSpace submission form.
