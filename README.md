# frida
Cristin metadata extraction with DSpace submission autofill using user scripts (tapermonkey/greasemonkey)

To actually make this work, Saxonce is needed. It should be installed in to the frida directory.

Also you need either greasemonkey extension for firefox or tapermonkey for google and enable the user scripts.

The user scripts will run on the page and magic will happen.

When it works, one can paste an xml-file with cristin metadata, get html extracted, and then auto-fill in DSpace submission form.
